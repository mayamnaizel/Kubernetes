# Introduction to Kubernetes

This repository contains notes, examples, and resources from my completion of the **[Introduction to Kubernetes](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-kubernetes/)** course offered by **The Linux Foundation**.

## About the Course

**Introduction to Kubernetes** is a beginner-friendly course that covers the fundamentals of Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform. It provides a practical understanding of how to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
